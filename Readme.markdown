This is an app to make it easier for Turing School students to complete cleanup duties.

As of now (Aug-7-2015) we have a list of posse cleanup duties but there's not way to keep track of which tasks have been completed and which tasks have not. Having a checklist would communicate posse cleanup duty progress. Throughout the week, posse members can see how close they are to completing the list of cleanup duties,
 - which makes it easier for posse members to do cleanup
 - which makes it more likely that people will complete the cleanup chores
 - making the Turing space more enjoyabe to be in,
 - making people happier and more productive.

At the end of each week, completion statistics get recorded/documented and sent to staff. Then, a fresh list becomes available for the next posse.

Statistics may indicate patterns of certain duties that never get completed by any posses, which may create insights about barriers, roadblocks, or hindrances to completing certain tasks.
